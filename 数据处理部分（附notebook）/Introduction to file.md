此文件包含数据处理代码，对象是六轴数据的raw data。其中分为针对Android和IOS系统的两个python脚本，请对应使用。这是因为两种系统的手机产生六轴数据的频率有差异，在滑窗分割数据时要使训练数据和最终测试时产生的数据量一致。详情请见知乎说明文档。
This file contains the data processing code, the object is the raw data of the six-axis data. It is divided into two python scripts for Android and IOS systems, please use them accordingly. This is because there is a difference in the frequency of six-axis data generated by the phones of the two systems, and it is important to make the training data and the amount of data generated in the final test consistent when sliding the window to split the data. For details, please refer to the documentation of Zhihu instructions.
